# Dt Money - DDD / SOLID / Front-end

Project to study DDD and SOLID in the front-end.

This project is part of Rockeseat bootcamp, as a personal challenge, I'm using DDD, SOLID, Clean code, covering the scenarios with testing.

For the testing, I'm using Jest and Testing-library.

On the "presentation" layer I'm using Tailwind.

To separate the states from the ui layer, I used React's hook concept.
